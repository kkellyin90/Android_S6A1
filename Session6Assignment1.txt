4. What is the alternative of ActionBarActivity as its deprecated?
A: An alternative to ActionBarActivity is AppCompatActivity. 
   The deprecation of ActionBarActivity is a hint for one to use the new AppCompatActivity directly.
   AppCompatActivity is a new, more generic implementation which uses AppCompatDelegate class internally.
   To make it work you must create an instance of AppCompatDelegate inside your activity, override methods of that activity like addContentView(), 
   setContentView() etc and inside those overridden methods forward the calls to inner AppCompatDelegate instance. 
   AppCompatDelegate will do the rest and your “old-fashion” activity will be “materialized”.
